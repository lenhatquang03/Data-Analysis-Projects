    "# Candlestick charts are commonly used in financial visual to show price movements in securiies (chứng khoán). Securitues are fungible (easy to trade for something else of the same type and value) and tradable financial instruments used to raise capital (to raise funds from external sources to achieve its strategic goals) in public and private markets. There are primarily 3 types of securities:\n",
    "   # Equity (tài sản ròng - vốn chủ sở hữu): An equity security represents ownership interest held by shareholders in an entity (a compay, partnership, etc.) realized in the form of shares of capital stock.\n",
    "   # Debt (government and corporate bonds - trái phiếu): A debt securities represents borrowed money that must be repaid, with terms that stipulate the size of the loan, interest rate, etc.\n",
    "   # Hybrid: Hybrid securities combine some of the characteristics of both debt and equity securities like convertible bonds (bonds that can be converted into shares of common stocks in the issuing company) and preference shares (company stocks whose payments of interest, diviends, or other returns of capital can be prioritized over those of other stockholders).\n",

    "# SMA (Simple Moving Average) is simply the mean of the stock price values over the specified period. It's called \"moving\" because it is plotted on the chart bar by bar, forming a line that moves along the chart as the average value changes.\n",
    " # SMAs are often used to determine trend direction. If the SMA is moving up, the trend is up. If it's moving down, the trend is down. A 200-bar SMA is common proxy for the long term trend. 50-bar SMAs are typically used to gauge the intermediate trend. Shorter SMAs are for shorter trends.\n",
    " # Price crossing SMA is oftern used to trigger trading signals. When prices cross above the SMA, you might want to \"go long\" or \"cover short\". When they cross below the SMA, you might want to \"go short\" or \"exit long\".\n",
    " # SMA crossing SMA is another common trading signal. When a short period SMA crosses above a long period SMA, you may want to \"go long\". You may want to \"go short\" when the short-term SMA crosses back below the long-term SMA.\n",

    "# Understanding a Long Position vs. a Short Position\n",
    " # Long position (vị thế mua): if an investor has long positions, it means that the investor has bought and owns those shares of stocks. For instance, an investor who owns 100 shares of Tesla stock in their portfolio is said to be \"long 100 shares\". The investor has paid in full the cost of owning the shares and will make monet if they rise in value and are later sold for more than they were bought.\n",
    " # Short Position (vị thế bán): if the investor has short positions, it means that the investor ows those stocks to someone, but doesn't actually own them yet. Continuing the example, an investor who has sold 100 shares of Tesla without yet owning those shares is said to be \"short 100 shares\". The short investor owes 100 shares at settlement and must fulfill the obligation by purchasing the shares in the market to deliver. Oftentimes, the short investor borrows the shares from a brokerage firm through a margin account (tài khoản kí quỹ) to make the delivery. Then, if all goes to plan, the investor buy the shares at a lower price to pay back the dealer. The goal here is for the stock price to fall. If the price doesn't fall and keeps going up, the short seller may be subject to a margin call (lệnh gọi ký quỹ) from their broker. A margin call  occurs when an investor's account value falls below the broker's required minimum value. The call is for the investor to deposit additional money or securites so that the margin account is brought up to the minimum maintenance margin.\n",
    " # When it comes to stocks, \"going long\" means buying a stock and profiting from it rising in value. On the other hand, \"going short\" implies betting and making monet from the stock falling in value.\n",
    " # \"Short covering\" refers to buying back borrowed securities in order to close out an open short position at a profit or loss. It requires purchasing the same security that was initially sold short and handling back the shares initially borrowed for the short sale. For example, a trader sells short 100 shares of XYZ at $20, based on the opinion that those shares will head lower. If XYZ declines to $15, the trader buys back XYZ to cover the short position, booking a $500 profit from the sale.\n",
    " # An exit point is the price at which an investor or trader closes a position. It's often predetermined based on a trading strategy or valuation model (Fundamental/technical analysis). Then, an order is sent out to initiate the exit.\n",
    "  # Types of Exit Point Orders:\n",
    "   # A profit target is typically a limit order.\n",
    "   # A stop loss order is typically a stop market order.\n",
    " # If an investor is long an asset, they would place a limit order above the current price. When the price reaches that level, their order will be sitting there ready to be filled. The stop loss goes below their entry price. The order is triggered only if the stock price is reached. When it is, a market order is sent out to sell the asset at the current market price.\n",

    "# Bollinger Bands gives traders an idea of where the market is moving based on prices. It involves the use of 3 bands - one for the upper level, another for the lower level, and the third for moving average. When prices move closer to the upper band, it indicates that the market may be overbought. Conversely, the market may be oversild when prices end up moving closer to the bottom band.\n",
